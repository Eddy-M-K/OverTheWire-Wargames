# OverTheWire-Wargames-Security-Preparation
This repository serves as personal note-taking storage for my own security/hacking/CTF preparation with write-ups, solutions, etc.

Examples include:
- OverTheWire's Wargames: Puzzle games played by SSHing into various Linux servers
- TryHackMe: Hands-on cybersecurity training

Do NOT view the contents of this repository if you do not want to get the puzzle solutions spoiled for you.
